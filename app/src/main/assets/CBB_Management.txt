Before Planting
Consult with government agricultural authorities for disease-tolerant cassava varieties
Soaking infested seeds in hot water at 60°C for 20 minutes, followed by drying in shallow layers at 30°C overnight or at 50°C for 4 hours, significantly reduces bacterial levels
During Growth
Remove infected plants, but do this only during dry periods to avoid spreading the disease through water droplets
After Harvest
After harvesting, gather all stems and debris and either burn or bury them, keeping only carefully selected cuttings for the next planting
