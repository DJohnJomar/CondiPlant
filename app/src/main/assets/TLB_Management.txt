Before Planting
If possible, make gardens in the highlands, above 500 m as the disease is less at cooler temperatures
Use of resistant varieties
During Growth
Cut off infected leaves as soon as they are seen 
Use copper fungicides (especially copper oxychloride) and metalaxyl (a systemic product)
After Harvest
Harvest when the leaves are dry
To prevent storage rots, wash the soil off the corms, trim the leaves and put them in plastic bags
