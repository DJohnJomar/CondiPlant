Cassava Leaf Blight (CLB) is a plant disease affecting cassava (Manihot esculenta), which is a staple food crop in many tropical and subtropical regions. The disease is caused by the fungal pathogen Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. manihotis.
Cassava Brown Spot is a fungal disease caused by Cercospora henningsii, affecting the leaves of cassava plants. It is characterized by the appearance of small, round, dark brown lesions on the leaves, which can merge to form larger necrotic areas. The disease is prevalent in regions with high humidity and can lead to significant yield losses by reducing the plantâ€™s photosynthetic capability. Managing the disease involves using resistant varieties, implementing proper crop rotation, and maintaining good field hygiene.
A healthy cassava plant exhibits robust growth, with large, vibrant green leaves and strong, thick stems. The roots or tubers, which are the primary harvestable part of the plant, develop fully without disease symptoms or deformities. Healthy cassava plants are free from signs of disease, pests, or nutrient deficiencies, which ensures maximum yield and quality. Proper agricultural practices, including the use of disease-free planting material and balanced fertilization, are essential for maintaining healthy cassava crops.
Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD) is a viral infection caused by a group of related viruses known as cassava mosaic begomoviruses (CMBs). It is characterized by a mosaic pattern of yellow and green on the leaves, stunted growth, and distorted leaves, which significantly reduce the yield of cassava plants. CMD is primarily spread by whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci) and through the use of infected planting material. Controlling the disease involves using resistant varieties, implementing strict phytosanitary measures, and managing vector populations.
Taro Leaf Blight (TLB) is a devastating disease caused by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora colocasiae, affecting taro plants. It is characterized by large, water-soaked lesions on the leaves, which rapidly expand, turning brown and causing the leaves to collapse and rot. TLB thrives in warm, wet conditions and can severely reduce taro yields, especially in regions with heavy rainfall. Controlling the disease involves using resistant varieties, applying fungicides, and implementing proper field sanitation practices to remove infected plant debris.
Taro Mosaic Disease is a viral infection caused by the Taro bacilliform virus (TaBV) and Taro vein chlorosis virus (TaVCV), affecting taro plants. The disease is characterized by mosaic-like mottling, chlorosis, and sometimes distortion of the leaves, which can reduce the plant's vigor and overall yield. The viruses are often spread through infected planting material and can also be transmitted by insects such as aphids. Management of Taro Mosaic includes the use of virus-free planting material, control of insect vectors, and crop rotation to prevent the spread of the virus.
