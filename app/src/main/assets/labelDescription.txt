Angular, water-soaked spots occur on the leaves which are restricted by the veins; the spots expand rapidly, join together, especially along the margins of the leaves, and turn brown with yellow borders
Leaf spots are circular, up to 15 mm diameter, becoming angular and limited by veins; the spots are brown with dark borders, sometimes surrounded by indistinct yellow margins;
Yellow patches occur along the secondary veins, those branching from the midribs, and they often join together; dieback occurs in the most susceptible varieties
Leaf mechanical damage happens when external forces like wind, hail, or human activities cause physical injuries to leaves, resulting in tearing or bruising. This can hinder the plant's ability to photosynthesize and affect its overall health. Insect damage occurs when insects feed on leaves, leading to visible harm such as holes, discoloration, or distortion. This not only weakens the plant but also makes it more vulnerable to diseases.
The leaf appears vibrant and undamaged, indicating it is in good health and free from any diseases.
Deformed and distorted leaves and shoots are common and plants are stunted; leaves show pale green to yellow patches, giving what is called a 'mosaic' pattern
Pest damage can lead to yellowing of leaves, often indicating that insects are feeding on the plant. This feeding can disrupt the plant's nutrient uptake and photosynthesis, causing leaves to lose their green color and turn yellow.
Very small brown spots on young leaves; spots become larger as the leaves approach full size; may develop pale yellow margins; sometimes the leaf spots run together to form large irregular blotches

Interveinal discoloration (yellowing); wilting (older leaves dry out and drop or hang from the stem)
The leaf appears vibrant and undamaged, indicating it is in good health and free from any diseases.
Brown necrotic lesions on older leaves, with a typical bullâ€™s eye appearance of concentric rings; blackened veins on leaf undersurface; lesions become necrotic usually surrounded by a wide yellow halo; Sometimes whitish to tan brown lesions surrounded by a dark purple to brown margin.; lesions are roundish with irregular borders;
Vein clearing; chlorotic spots; leaf curling; mosaic; stunting
Small, dark brown flecks or light brown spots on the upper leaf surface; the spots enlarge rapidly, becoming circular, zonate, and purplish brown to brown in color

Spots yellow at first; later, reddish brown spots and blotches with light brown centers, round or irregular up to 15 mm diameter
Light green streaks, feather-- like patches  appear along the main leaf veins or between them; others are over the main veins throughout the leaf
