Before Planting
Use of resistant varieties and ensure that planting sets are pathogen-free
Planting setts should be carefully inspected and should be treated with a broad- spectrum fungicide
During Growth
Removal of weeds that may be alternative hosts
Interplant with maize; presumably this is to increase the spacing between plants
Benomyl, chlorothalonil, copper, dithiocarbamates have been recommended
After Harvest
Avoid damage to the tubers at harvest to avoid infection of tubers by spores of Colletotrichum
Crop rotation
Ploughing-in plant residues immediately after harvest are likely to reduce disease development
