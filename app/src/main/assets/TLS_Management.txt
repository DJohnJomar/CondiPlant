Before Planting
Ensure enough spacing between Taro plants to facilitate air circulation and avoid wet foliage
Avoid overhead watering and irrigate Taro at the root level to keep the foliage dry
During Growth
Regular removal and disposal of infected foliage can help reduce disease spread
Foliar applications of fungicides can control the disease. Multi-site protectants like mancozeb are generally recommended
After Harvest
Implementing crop rotation with non-host plants can disrupt the disease's lifecycle, reducing its recurrence
