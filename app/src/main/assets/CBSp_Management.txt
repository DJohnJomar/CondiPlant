Before Planting
Space plants widely to allow the wind to dry the leaves faster
If healthy planting material is unavailable, treat cassava stems by dipping them in a diluted fungicide solution to eliminate the fungus before planting
During Growth
In the dry season, remove severely infected leaves to prevent rapid fungal spread when the rains begin
If chemical control is necessary, use copper-based fungicides or mancozeb
After Harvest
Rotate crops every 3 to 5 years
Gather and burn plant debris
