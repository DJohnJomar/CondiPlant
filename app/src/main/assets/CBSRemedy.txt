Plant at wide spacing, allowing the wind to dry the leaves as quickly as possible.
Plant in the wet season, so that crops are in the susceptible stage in the dry season.
Do not plant new crops next to old ones with the disease.
During the dry season remove heavily diseased leaves to prevent the fungus spreading quickly when the rains start.
All crop husks that are infected should be destroyed to reduce the disease spreading to the next planting.
