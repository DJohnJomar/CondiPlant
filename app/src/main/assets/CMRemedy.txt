Do not establish new plots next to those that are infected with the mosaic disease, especially if the young plots are downwind.
Collect and destroy stems of those plants that showed symptoms of cassava mosaic symptoms.
Use resistant crop varieties whenever possible; work with a disease tolerant variety.
Keep the cropsâ€™ close surroundings and environmental conditions neat by removing weeds and closeby plants that are non-cultivated and unprotected.
