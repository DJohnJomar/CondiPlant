Rotate cassava crop with non-host; plow crop debris into soil after harvest or remove and burn it; prune infected parts from plant; propagate cuttings only from healthy plants.
Do not plant new plots of cassava next to those that are infected by the disease. And do not plant downwind as bacteria could be spread in wind-driven rain to the new planting.
Do not plant crops of cassava one after another on the same land, especially if the last crop had the disease.
Cut out infected plants if only a few plants show symptoms; only do this during dry times, otherwise the disease may be spread in water droplets, and collect all the stems and other debris after harvest and burn or bury them, except for the cuttings carefully chosen for planting the next crop.
