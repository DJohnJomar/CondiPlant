Before Planting
Utilize virus-free planting materials
Choose propagation materials exclusively from healthy, unaffected plants
Plant physical barriers between fields and farms to reduce whitefly movement
Dip cuttings in pesticide before planting and spray the leaves of young, growing plants
During Growth
Remove and destroy diseased plants (roguing)
Apply soap or oil sprays multiple times to control whitefly populations
Treat seed cuttings with pesticides, such as the systemic neonicotinoid imidacloprid, before distributing them to farmers
After Harvest
Gather and burn stems from plants displaying disease symptoms on leaves or roots
