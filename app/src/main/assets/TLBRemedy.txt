Make new gardens as far away as possible from old ones. Do not plant gardens downwind from older gardens with the disease.
If possible, make gardens in the highlands, above 500 meters as the disease is less at cooler temperatures.
Inspect young taro twice a week; cut off infected leaves as soon as they are seen.
Remove infected leaves during the early stages of disease development, tend to be more effective in small plantings, such as subsistence taro gardens.
Wide spacing of plants to reduce spread of disease, using sites surrounded by forest as a barrier to disease spread, isolation of new crops from those that are diseased, and the use of planting material free from disease.
Intercropping of taro with other crops may help in reducing disease.
